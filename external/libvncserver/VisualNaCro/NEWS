With --timing, you can actually record action scripts which are meaningful...
Earlier, the events just got garbled, because the GUI could not react as
fast as the events were churned out.

Clipboard is supported (thanks to Uwe).

Keys are recorded by their symbols with the --symbolic switch, provided you
have the X11::Keysyms module.

After pressing Control twice, you can show the last reference image with 'd'.
